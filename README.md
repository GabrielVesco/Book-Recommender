# Book Recommender
For this project we developed a book recommender model that gives the user a recommendation for a book based on three book inputs from the user. We use historical data from each user as well as the total ratings of these books plus how many reviews it has as variables in our model. We use R-Shiny to deploy our application.

# The Model
We use three approaches to generate the book recommendations - Popularity-Based recommender, User-Based Collaborative Filter, and an Item-Based Collaborative Filter. Additionally there is a random recommender and a re-recommender. We test all of these for their accuracy and choose the most accurate one.
